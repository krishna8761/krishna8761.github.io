      <h3>How I Manage My College and Personal Life</h3>
      <p>Hi, Iâ€™m Krishna Soni, a student currently exploring my interests, building habits, and trying to improve myself one step at a time.</p>
      <p>This is my very first blog postâ€”and honestly, Iâ€™m as excited as I am nervous.  
      I decided to start this blog as part of my first mini project. Instead of just writing random things, I wanted to make it personal.  
      So, Iâ€™ll be sharing stories about my life, my journey, and the things Iâ€™m learning along the way.</p>

      <h3>My Web Development Journey</h3>
      <p>Right now, Iâ€™m learning web development and I want to share my journey so far.  
      I recently started learning, and it feels overwhelming at timesâ€”but also fun.  
      Writing my first HTML form felt like an achievement (even though it was a small project).  
      I believe sharing my journeyâ€”mistakes, small wins, and experimentsâ€”can not only track my progress but maybe inspire someone else too.</p>
